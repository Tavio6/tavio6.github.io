        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p id="subtitle">(experience)</p>
        <p>I am Tavi, a long time Game Developer with 
            over 7+ years of Experience<br> (as of 2025), 
            especially on Unity and
            Godot, and as of recently with close to 3 years of 
            Experience with Roblox.<br>
            I'm mostly a Generalist with a specialization in 3D
            and 2D art, but i can do many other things as well,
            such as scripting, especially with Python, Luau, C#
            and C++, i've been at it since i was 11, so i am 
            pretty confident with tackling with most complex of
            problems!<br>
            Below you can see some of the projects i 
            have worked on.
